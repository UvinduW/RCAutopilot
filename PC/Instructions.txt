** General Setup **
- Raspberry Pi should be connected to the same network as the PC

- VNC into it (SSH should work too, though not tested)
	Username: pi; Password: raspberry
	Remote Desktop Viewer on Ubuntu should work for VNC
	IP Address of Pi tends to be 192.68.0.101-103 on TP-Link

- The only script that needs to be run is "Combined_Client.py"
	This script needs to be run only after the script on the PC has started


** To collect training data and train the CNN **
- Open Gamepad_Driver_Server.py

- Ensure the image capture variables are set to allow image
	capture and the starting number for the images is appropriate

- Ensure gamepad is connected to computer before running the script

- Run the script

- Run the "Combined_Client.py" script on the Raspbery Pi

- Wait for camera display to show up on PC

- Press "A" on the gamepad to start recording images if image
	capture is paused

- Check "training_images" folder to ensure images are being captured

- To pause capture, press "A" again on the gamepad

- To stop the script press "B" on the gamepad

- Images should now be found in the "training_images" folder

- Move the images so that they are in the "training_images" folder
	in the "For Training" folder

- Open the "train.py" file

- Adjust epochs or other necessary settings

- Run the script

- Generated file can be found in the "save" folder with the file
	name "model.ckpt"

- Copy this file to the "save" folder within the "Working" folder
	so the main script to drive the car can access it


** To playback training data with the trained CNN **
- Go to the "For Training" folder

- Open and run the "run_dataset_edit.py" file 


** To run the car **
- Open Gamepad_Driver_Server.py

- Ensure all user configurable settings are set as needed

- Ensure gamepad is connected to computer before running the script

- Run the script

- Wait until IP address is printed in the terminal

- Ensure client script on Raspberry Pi has same IP address

- Run the script on the Raspberry Pi

- Wait for camera feed window to show on computer (you should alse here a
	couple of beeps from the car)

- Now the car should be ready. It starts off in autonomous mode with zero
	throttle

- Use gamepad keys as follows:

Start - Toggle between manual and autonomous mode
Right trigger - Forwards throttle
Left trigger - Reverse throttle
Left thumbstick - Steering input (needs to be centered properly for 
	autonomous mode to activate - otherwise it can think there is some manual
	input being given)
A - Toggle capturing images to disk
B - Quits the script
X - Decrement speed of car when in autonomous mode
Y - Increment speed of car when in autonomous mode

Note: If car is in autonomous mode, it will revert to manual mode if gamepad
      is also giving driving commands. It will revert back to autonomous
      mode once the gamepad input stops.
